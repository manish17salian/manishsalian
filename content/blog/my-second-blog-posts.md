Each post has frontmatter like:



\- \`title\`

\- \`date\`

\- \`excerpt\`

![](/uploads/manishsalian_profile.jpg)

…and then the Markdown body.



\## What I want to improve next



\- Add a \`/blog/\[slug]\` page to read full posts

\- Add tags and search

\- Add a featured post section on the home page



If you’re building something similar, keep the setup simple first—then make it pretty.
