## Welcome 👋

This is my first post written in **Markdown** and managed through **Decap CMS**.

### What I’m building

- A portfolio site (Next.js App Router)
- A blog powered by Decap CMS
- Deployed on Vercel

### Next steps

1. Add more posts
2. Create a post detail page: `/blog/[slug]`
3. Add styling + pagination

Thanks for reading!
